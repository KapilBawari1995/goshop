Ensure the website is fully responsive, meaning it should work well on both desktop and mobile. You can use Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or CSS media queries for responsiveness.



9. State Management (For Cart):
Use React State or React Context API to manage the cart data. When the user adds or removes items from the cart, you will update the state to reflect the changes on the UI.




10. Frontend Features without Backend:
Since you won’t be using a backend for now, you can use fake data or a third-party API to simulate real data. For example:

Fake API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, FakestoreAPI, etc.): You can use APIs like FakestoreAPI to fetch products and product details.
Local Storage: Use browser localStorage to save cart items, so when users refresh the page, their cart data doesn’t get lost.
Static Data: You can also use a hardcoded array of products to simulate product data and allow interaction.
11. Tools and Libraries for Frontend:
React: Build your UI components and manage routing.
React Router: For navigation between pages (Home, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, etc.).
Axios: For fetching data from external APIs (like product lists).
React Context API/Redux: For managing cart state globally across components.
Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS: For fast and responsive UI design.
